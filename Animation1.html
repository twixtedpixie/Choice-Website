            Humorous Phases of Funny Faces
        </h3>
        <p>
            While not the most advanced, created in 1906 and directed by James Stuart Blackton, Humorous Phases of Funny Faces is credited as the first cartoon recorded on standard picture film.
            It's a stop motion silent film of an artist drawing various faces and caricatures in chalk on a chalkboard. While not meant to fit the critera of cartoons interacting with humans, I feel due to the fact that you could see a few of the drawings being drawn/erased by a human it should get a mention.
