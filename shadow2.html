                    Onto the primary plot of Sonic Adventure 2 (with additions from other games to provide more complete lore), Shadow the Hedgehog was created in a lab aboard the Space Colony Ark by Dr. Gerald Robotnik, Eggman/Ivo Robotnik's Grandfather. Shadow was created because Gerald's grandaughter Maria (The girl shown), was sick and after making a deal is an Alien warlord by the name of Black doom, Gereld was promised the power of chaos control which he gave to Shadow with hopes he could use it and Shadow to help cure Maria in exchange for making Black doom a solider, this being Shadow. The research on the ark was financed by the government and G.U.N. who deemed it too dangerous and shut it down violently in an attack on the ark where Maria was shot and killed in the crossfire as she placed Shadow in stasis, she says some last words which will not be said right now. In his grief, Gereld creates a world destroying weapon and alters Shadow's memories so he remember's Maria's last words as being to avenge her and to carry our Gereld's instructions to destory the planet with the weapon
