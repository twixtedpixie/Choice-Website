                    Hello, this website will be going over the story and characters of homestuck. I will not be going into the epilogues and beyond cannon because I'm not insane. Also I haven't finished reading beyond cannon yet. Do you know how long homestuck is? DO YOU? I already need to summerize just over 8000 pages of story, characters, two planets both with their own alternate world, three earths, two species of alien, the ancestors of one of those groups of aliens (one of these ancestors being basically jesus, no I'm not kidding), the hemospectrum and the caste system based around it and the roles each blood caste member plays in society and how likely they are to be instantly slaughtered by their race's matriachal dictator, the alien martriarchal dictator and the way she was a warlord who conqured most of her universe and the way she became betty crocker in a new universe and conquered the earth installing juggalos as co-presidents to be puppet rulers for her (Once again, I cannot make this shit up), and if I keep talking I will be here for ages. This is a labor of love. I haven't even mentioned the game mechanics and coding jokes
