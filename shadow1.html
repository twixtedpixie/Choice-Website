                    Shadow, was first introduced in Sonic Adventure 2 as an antagonist on team dark. In the game he is mistaken for Sonic by the public and G.U.N. when he steals a chaos emerald and Sonic becomes framed as a criminal for this. While he doesn't look much like Sonic people have theorized that he gets mistaken for sonic so often because his scrapped design Terios looked much more like Sonic than Shadow does and the mistaken identity stuff is an artifact from before Shadow was decided on, though Terios could only pass for Sonic from a distance with the only real similarity being in color, as shown in the provided image. Personally I'm not sure if I believe this reason for the identity shenanegains in Sonic Adventure 2, but I tend to just ignore that discrepency in favor of screaming at final rush as I die for the 55th time in a row cause I suck at that level then go switch to the dark story as a cop-out til I can't procrastinate on final rush anymore if I want to finish the game, fight the bio-lizard, and listen to live and learn in the game's background.
