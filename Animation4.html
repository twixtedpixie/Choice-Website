            The Alice Comedies
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Aice Comedies, were created by Walt Disney studios as one of their first works. They stared a live action girl in a cartoon world with Julius, a cartoon cat (which may or may not have been an attempt at a felix the cat rip off). Most interesting to me is that these cartoons were where Pete the cat was first introduced, he was originally a bear and he debuted in the cartoon Alice Solves the Puzzle, continuing to be an adversary to many cartoon characters, showing up again against Oswald the Lucky Rabbit and Mickey Mouse where he became a cat.
